Hearing-impaired people face significant challenges due to their inability to perceive auditory cues, such as emergency sirens, alarms, and traffic sounds.  These cues are essential for alerting people to potential dangers and ensuring their safety.  Without auditory awareness, hearing-impaired people may not be aware of approaching emergency vehicles, fire alarms, or even oncoming traffic, which can lead to life-threatening situations.

According to the World Health Organization, around 466 million people worldwide have a disabling hearing loss, which accounts for approximately 5% of the global population.  In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that about 15% of adults aged 18 and over experience some degree of hearing loss.

In an attempt to address this problem, I have created SonicSight AR.  This device uses machine learning to recognize sounds, like emergency vehicles and various types of alarms.  When these sounds are detected, the user of SonicSight AR is alerted to that fact via a message that floats within their field of vision through the use of a low-cost augmented reality display.

SonicSight AR also solves some other unique problems often experienced by the hearing-impaired — it also detects footsteps and talking to prevent the wearer from being startled when someone approaches them unexpectedly.
